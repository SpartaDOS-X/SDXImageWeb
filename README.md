SDX Imager is a tool for customizing SpartaDOS X ROM images. The full-featured version for Windows has been available from several years at [SDX Upgrade Project website](https://sdx.atari8.info/index.php?show=en_addons).
This version runs in a Web browser. You can edit the default CONFIG.SYS and add or remove files. The customized SDX image can then be flashed to a cartridge or used with SDX-compatible hardware.
